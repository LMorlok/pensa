Tutorials
===============

*The tutorial on this site is not yet complete!*
We are still working on unifying and integrating tutorials for new functionality.

For now, to access the tutorials, see the `tutorial <https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/tree/master/tutorial>`_ section of the GitHub repo.

The tutorial folder contains 

- examples to run the pre-defined python scripts
- an example `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/blob/master/tutorial/PENSA_Tutorial_GPCRmd_MOR.ipynb>`_ that demonstrates all library functionality from version 0.1.
- two python scripts that demonstrate density-based features and state-specific information, respectively.

An animated version of the notebook is on `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1difJjlcwpN-0hSmGCGrPq9Cxq5wJ7ZDa>`_.

Feel free to get in touch or open an issue if you have questions!
