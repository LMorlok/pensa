- [ ] Weighted PCA/tICA? (to account for varying simulation lengths or uncertainty) 
- [ ] Feature comparison of more than two ensembles
  - [ ] with respect to the joint ensemble (all metrics)
  - [ ] with respect to a reference ensemble (will not always work for KLD)
- [ ] Implement T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - [ ] Read up on [t-SNE for molecular trajectories](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00132/full)
  - [ ] See if we can import or adapt [existing code](https://github.com/spiwokv/tltsne).
  - [ ] First tests with (regular) t-SNE
  - [ ] Test time-lagged t-SNE. How to handle time-dependence across simulations/ensembles?
  - [ ] write module
  - [ ] write unit tests
- [ ] Implement a clustering algorithem designed for structural ensembles
  - [ ] Read up about [CLoNe](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa742/5895303) 
  - [ ] First tests
  - [ ] write module
  - [ ] write unit tests
- [ ] Put shared functionality of PCA and TICA into shared functions.

- [ ] Implement [Non-Negative Matrix Factorization](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.3170050203).
- [ ] Implement nucleic acid torsions and pseudo-torsions, as reviewed [Keating et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quarterly-reviews-of-biophysics/article/new-way-to-see-rna/2A2D428A5FAB150D2488A5A1D87007BD) and as used in [x3DNA](https://x3dna.org/highlights/pseudo-torsions-to-simplify-the-representation-of-dna-rna-backbone-conformation) or [Barnaba](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/25/2/219) ([Barnaba code on GitHub](https://github.com/srnas/barnaba))

### Ideas
- [ ] Logo
- [ ] Hydrogen bonds as features
- [ ] Contacts as features 
  - [ ] can PyEMMA do this?
  - [ ] Think about a [GetContacts](https://getcontacts.github.io/) reader
- [ ] Position deviations as features (similar to components of RMSD)
- [ ] Estimate thresholds for significance of feature differences
  - [ ] Calculate correlation times within trajectories
  - [ ] modify p-value of KS test using correlation time 
  - [ ] modify p-value of KS test using number of simulation runs per ensemble
- [ ] Wasserstein distance to compare ensembles
- [ ] Add option to whiten features
- [ ] Featurizers for other molecule types
  - [ ] ligands
  - [ ] lipids
  - [ ] nucleic acids
- [ ] Account for [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) in comparison.
- [ ] Implement conformational entropy calculations
  - [ ] Read papers, e.g, [1](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/43/15396), [2](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/6/1/21/htm), [3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01375)
  - [ ] Test implementations, e.g., [Xentropy](https://github.com/liedllab/X-Entropy) to find the best way to do it.
- [ ] Implement [multi-dimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)
- [ ] Try to integrate [functional mode analysis](http://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/de_groot/fma.html).
- [ ] Try to integrate [VAMPnets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02388-1).
- [ ] Try to integrate [network analysis](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0020974).
- [ ] Try to integrate [Deep learning the slow modes for rare events sampling](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/44/e2113533118)
- [ ] Check out [correlationplus](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00742)
- [ ] Improve clusering using [Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11424)
